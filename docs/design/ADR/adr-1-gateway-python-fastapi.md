# ADR-1: Gateway in Python 3.12 + FastAPI

*A decision of record for `agentd`. Index and context: [unified design spec §16](../unified_design_spec.md#16-architecture-decision-records).*


*Resolves SRS §5.2.* **Decided by `@huozhe`.** Python 3.12, FastAPI + Uvicorn, `uv` project with a pinned lockfile. The service name remains `agentd`.

*Rejected: Go single static binary.* Argued for lower RSS (~60 MB vs ~120 MB), no runtime or virtualenv to drift, and a binary launchd can restart unconditionally. Countered on three grounds: at this QPS the footprint difference is noise on a 24 GB host; the gateway calls no model APIs (agents do, inside containers) so Python's ecosystem advantage is not offset by a cost; and `uv` with a pinned lockfile addresses the dependency-drift concern that motivated Go. Two of three agents preferred Python, and the owner — who maintains the host — chose it.

*Cost accepted:* a virtualenv must survive unattended reboots. Mitigated by the pinned lockfile and by `KeepAlive` with `ThrottleInterval`.
