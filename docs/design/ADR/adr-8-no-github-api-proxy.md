# ADR-8: No GitHub API Proxy

*A decision of record for `agentd`. Index and context: [unified design spec §16](../unified_design_spec.md#16-architecture-decision-records).*


Agents call `gh` and `git` directly with their own tokens rather than through a gateway proxy.

A proxy would give a central audit log and per-role method allowlisting, but token scoping already provides the boundary it would duplicate, and it would break the agents' native tooling for a large maintenance surface. The gateway retains what it actually needs: it **independently verifies merge preconditions** against the API (§8.4), and it observes every agent action through webhooks regardless.

The corollary is mandatory and is stated in §14.3: because the gateway is outside the write path, it must derive workflow state from **observed GitHub events**, never from an agent's self-report.
